## Reasoning:

As a boot camp graduate from General Assembly DC Chapter (Sep. 2019) and a mentor to other boot camp students. I desired to build this game out for a while now. Also, I enjoy building apps. 

## Future Plans:

To have autocompletion on searching characters and moving images so they load correctly.
